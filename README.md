# Project Overview
Here is a simple game of Simon Says. If you are unsure on how this game works then here is a quick overview.
One person is Simon (The computer in this instance), and the other players follow Simon's instructions. Simon tells the players what they must do. The players must
obey all commands. If they fail to do so then they lose the game.

# Why this was created
This project was created to showcase my knowledge when it comes to intermediate JavaScript. I had also shown my knowledge in this project
of HTML, CSS, and Jquery. I had also created basic animations with Jqeury to add that level of realism to the game.
